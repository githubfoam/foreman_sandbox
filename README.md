# Foreman Sandbox

Foreman ansible
~~~~
Foreman Ansible allows you to import hosts via Ansible, along with facts about these hosts and reports of their playbook runs. This plugin 2.x series should be compatible with any version of Foreman above 1.17, including 1.17. Foreman Ansible relies on Foreman Remote Execution in order to be able to run playbooks remotely.
